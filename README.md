# Oktane15 Platform Lab

The Okta platform makes many powerful features available through
our APIs and SDKs.  Whether you are managing authentication and 
application access for the employees of your enterprise, or
providing the identity infrastructure for other business units
of your company to launch their business initiatives, or
providing federated authentication and provisioning support in
your cloud offering for your valuable customer - this session
will provide deep insights and hands-on labs to demonstrate some
advanced usages of the platform.
