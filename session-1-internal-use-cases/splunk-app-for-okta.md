# Splunk App for Okta

As an Okta customer, your Okta instance captures valuable
information regarding user activities, and application access over
time – including details about devices, location, browser
information, etc. This app collects data through the Okta platform
APIs with the primary focus on system log events. The app can also
present the “latest snapshot” on users, groups and apps.

Out-of-the-box dashboards are provided to give immediate insights on
your Okta data based on events.
